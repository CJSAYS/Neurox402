# 🧠 NEURO — Autonomous Agents That Pay and Coordinate

**NEURO** is an open framework for building autonomous economic agents powered by the HTTP 402 payment pattern.  
It’s designed for researchers, developers, and builders creating networks of intelligent systems that can **think, pay, and collaborate**.

> “Agents that can think are powerful.  
> Agents that can pay are unstoppable.”

## ⚡ Overview

NEURO introduces a lightweight agent runtime and protocol layer for **economic coordination** between AI systems.  
Each agent runs locally or in a swarm, performing tasks, reasoning, and exchanging value through **402-style micropayments**.

Core features include:
- 💸 **402 Payment Hooks** — bill per request, per token, or per inference.
- 🧩 **Composable Agents** — easily combine specialized models or LLM endpoints.
- ⚙️ **Facilitator Layer** — handles payment routing, token balances, and task logging.
- 🕸️ **Swarms** — orchestrate multiple agents with distinct roles in a shared environment.
